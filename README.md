The increasing prominence of neural networks
and AI models across diverse fields in medicine
plays a pivotal role in extracting complex
dependencies from data, making predictions, and
aiding decision-making processes. In IVF, it is
essential to conduct additional analyses and
modeling of protocol data, especially
embryological components, to enhance outcome
predictions for the cycle and to develop
personalized highly effective medical care.
Developing a Deep Learning Neural Network
(DNN) Model:
Integration of KPI data and KPI Score correlations
into the DNN with 20 clinical and laboratory
parameters for pregnancy prediction.
Model Training and Performance:
Training on a comprehensive dataset from 2013-
2023, with 3858 embryo transfer cases used for
the model with implementation using the KERAS
library for the model development.

Results of Validation and Specificity:
Validation across 10 randomly shuffled data
frames, demonstrating a 96.8% specificity and
63% accuracy in predicting clinical pregnancy.
Occurrence of false-positive predictions - 15.5%.
Average model accuracy of 67.9%, SD 5.4%,
maximum accuracy of 83.1%. Further model
refinement through additional training on a new
dataset from 2018 to 2023 (1600 protocols),
resulting in an average accuracy of 85.5% and a
maximum cross-validated accuracy of 88.6%.
Evaluation of model errors through the analysis of
168 protocols with PGT-A, revealing a 27% error
rate in predicting clinical pregnancy.
Superiority of the model&#39;s predictive accuracy
(85.5%) compared to literature-reported expert
predictions based on clinical and laboratory
parameters (51%, range 43â€“59%). Model has
accuracy and reproducibility comparable to state-
of-the-art models in time-lapse imaging.
Conclusion:
The developed model exhibits robust predictive
capabilities in clinical pregnancy outcomes,
surpassing traditional models of ML, offering
potential applications in quality control as a tool
for remote monitoring of IVF department
performance and serving as a valuable quality
control and decision support in IVF clinics.
