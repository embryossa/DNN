# Regularized SimpleRNN Model for Binary Classification

This repository contains a Python script for creating and training a SimpleRNN neural network model with regularization for binary classification. The model is implemented using the Keras library and TensorFlow backend.

## Overview

The provided script (`create_regularized_model.py`) defines a function `create_regularized_model()` that creates a Sequential model with a SimpleRNN layer, dropout, and regularization. The model is trained on three datasets (training, validation, and test sets) for binary classification.

## Dependencies

Ensure you have the following Python libraries installed:

- Keras
- TensorFlow
- Scikit-learn
- NumPy
- Pandas

## Usage

1. Import necessary libraries:

```python
from keras.models import Sequential
from keras.layers import Dense, SimpleRNN
from tensorflow.keras.optimizers import Adam
from tensorflow.keras import regularizers
from keras.layers import Dropout
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from keras.regularizers import l2
```

2. Define the function `create_regularized_model()` to create the model.

3. Create the model using the defined function:

```python
model = create_regularized_model()
```

4. Set training parameters (epochs, batch size).

5. Train the model:

```python
history = model.fit(X_train_reshaped, y_train, epochs=epochs, batch_size=batch_size, validation_data=(X_val_reshaped, y_val))
```

6. Make predictions and evaluate the model on the test set:

```python
y_pred = model.predict(X_test_reshaped)
test_loss, test_accuracy = model.evaluate(X_test_reshaped, y_test)
```

7. Save the trained model:

```python
model.save('neural_network_model.h5')
```

## Model Architecture

The model architecture consists of two SimpleRNN layers with activation functions, dropout regularization, and a final Dense layer with sigmoid activation for binary classification.

## Training Results

The training process is visualized by plotting the training accuracy over epochs.

```python
train_accuracy = history.history['accuracy']
```
